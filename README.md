# *The C Programming Language*, 2nd Edition Exercises

I tend to not include this sort of thing as a public repository, but after doing
some of these I feel that it's worthwhile. Unlike other programming books, this
book challenges you to write what are effectively real, practical programs.

I have a little bit of a C++ background, so my solutions are often a bit more
advanced than the book expects them to be, and they're all written with C99 in
mind instead of C89. That said, I'm still learning using the book, and writing
the programs as I go, so don't expect a perfect consistent level of quality
code. But, I try my best.

My code tries to adapt the Google C++ style guide to C as well, for reference.
